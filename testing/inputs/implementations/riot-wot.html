  <h4>RIOT WoT Implementation: TD Exposer</h4>
  <p>
  WoT modules for RIOT, a real-time operating system for the Internet of Things.
  </p>

  <p>
  The implementation provides data structures and serialization capabilities for generating and retrieving a RIOT device's TD using CoAP and DTLS (in PSK and RPK mode).
  The TD can be both discovered using <code>/.well-known/wot</code> and the CoRE Link Format (exposing the TD resource via <code>/.well-known/core</code>).
  Furthermore, the implementation includes a code generator that allows for translating an input Thing Model or Thing Description into C structures which will be used for serializing the device's TD.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time of writing, the implementation is not yet part of the RIOT upstream repository and only lives in a RIOT fork.
    However, the authors are working on integrating it into the RIOT upstream project.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Usage:</strong> RIOT-based applications can include the WoT modules via RIOT's Make-based build system.

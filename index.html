        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
           interoperability across IoT platforms and application
           domains.  One key mechanism for accomplishing this goal
           is the definition and use of metadata describing the
           interactions an IoT device or service makes available
           over the network at a suitable level of abstraction.  
           The WoT Thing Description specification satisfies this objective.
        </p>
        <p>However, in order to use a Thing its Thing Description
           first has to be obtained.  The <em>WoT Discovery</em> process described 
           in this document addresses this problem.
           WoT Discovery needs to support the distribution of WoT Thing Descriptions
           in a variety of use cases.  This includes ad-hoc and engineered systems;
           during development and at runtime; and on both local and global networks.
           The process also needs to work with existing discovery mechanisms,
           be secure, protect private information, and be able to efficiently
           handle updates to WoT Thing Descriptions and the 
           dynamic and diverse nature of the IoT ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>The WoT Discovery process is divided into two phases,
           Introduction, and Exploration.  The Introduction phase 
           leverages existing discovery mechanisms but does not directly
           expose metadata; they are simply used to discover Exploration
           services, which provide metadata but only after secure authentication
           and authorization.  This document normatively defines two Exploration
           services, one for WoT Thing self-description with a single 
           WoT Thing Description and a searchable WoT Thing Description Directory
           service for collections of Thing Descriptions.
           A variety of Introduction services are also described and where
           necessary normative definitions are given to support them.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Web of Things (WoT) defines an architecture that supports the integration
           and use of web technologies with IoT devices.
           The WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] document defines the basic
           concepts and patterns of usage supported.
           However, the WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]] is a key
           specification for WoT Discovery since it is the purpose of WoT Discovery
           to make WoT Thing Descriptions available.
           Specifically, WoT Discovery has to allow authenticated and authorized entities
           (and only those entities) to find WoT Thing Descriptions satisfying a set of
           criteria, such as being near a certain location, or having certain semantics,
           or containing certain interactions.  Conversely, in order to support
           security and privacy objectives, the WoT Discovery process must not
           leak information to unauthorized entities.  This includes leaking information
           that a given entity is requesting certain information, not just the information
           distributed in the Thing Descriptions themselves.
	    </p>
        <p>There are already a number of discovery mechanisms defined, so we have to 
           establish why we are proposing a new one.  First, many existing 
           discovery mechanisms have relatively weak security and privacy protections.
           One of our objectives is to establish a mechanism that not only uses best
           practices to protect metadata, but that can be upgraded to support future
           best practices as needed.
           Second, we are using discovery in a broad sense to include both local and
           non-local mechanisms.  While a local mechanism might use a broadcast protocol,
           non-local mechanisms might go beyond the current network segment where broadcast
           is not scalable, and so a different approach, such as a search service, is needed. 
           Our approach is to use existing mechanisms as needed to bootstrap into a more 
           general and secure metadata distribution system.
           Third, the metadata we are distributing, the WoT Thing Description, is highly
           structured and includes rich data such as data schemas and semantic annotations.
           Existing discovery mechanisms based on a list of simple key-value pairs are 
           not appropriate.  
           At the same time, 
           use of existing standards for semantic data query, 
           such as SPARQL [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]], 
           while potentially suitable for some advanced use cases, 
           might require too much effort for many anticipated IoT applications.
           Therefore in order to address more basic applications,
           we also define some simpler query mechanisms. 
        </p>
        <p>After defining some basic terminology, we will summarize the basic use cases and
           requirements for WoT Discovery.  These are a subset of the more detailed and
           exhaustive use cases and requirements presented in the WoT Use Cases [[wot-usecases]] and 
           WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture11]] documents.
           Then we will describe the basic architecture of the WoT Discovery process,
           which uses a two-phase Introduction/Exploration approach.  The basic goal of this
           architecture is to be able to use existing discovery standards to bootstrap
           access to protected discovery services, but to distribute detailed metadata only to 
           authorized users, and to also protect those making queries from eavesdroppers 
           as much as possible.
           We then describe details of specific Introduction and Exploration mechanisms.
           In particular, we define in detail a normative API for a 
           WoT Thing Description Directory (WoT TDD) service that provides a search mechanism for
           collections of WoT Thing Descriptions that can be dynamically registered by Things or
           entities acting on their behalf.  The WoT Discovery mechanism however also supports
           self-description by individual Things and one issue we address is how to distinguish
           between these two approaches.
           Finally, we discuss some security and privacy considerations, including a set of 
           potential risks and mitigations.

        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <p>
        <a href="#discovery-overview"></a> shows an overview of the WoT Discovery process.
	      Discovery uses a two-phase architecture to resolve the competing requirements to be
        both open and to restrict access to metadata to authorized entities.
	      In the first phase, one or more of a set of relatively open
        "Introduction" mechanisms may be used to generate a set of candidate URLs.  
        These URLs do not themselves contain metadata,
	      but are used in the second stage to reference "Exploration"
        services that can actually provide metadata, after authentication,
        in the form of <a>Thing Descriptions</a>.
       </p>
        <figure id="discovery-overview">
            <img src="images/overview.png"
                srcset="images/overview.svg"
                class="wot-diagram"
                alt="Discovery process overview" />
            <figcaption>Discovery architecture overview.  
              A set of open Introduction mechanisms provides a set of URLs, which
              point at Exploration services that only provide metadata (TDs) after suitable
              authentication.  Thing Links and Thing Description Directories provide
              additional flexibility but retrieving further results from these is
              at the discretion of the application.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
	       The intention is that Introductions are relatively open "first contact"
         mechanisms to provide a starting point for the rest of the Discovery process.
         In this document we do specify details on several Introduction
         mechanisms, suitable for different use cases, including both local and non-local
         scenarios, but Introductions can in fact be provided any mechanism that can return a URL, 
         including simply entering URLs directly.
	       Introductions, however, do not include any security or privacy controls and
	       so should not provide metadata directly.  
         Instead, the URLs provided by Introductions reference
	       "Exploration" services.  Exploration services actually provide metadata,
         but only after suitable security and privacy controls.
        </p>
	      <p>
	       The Discovery process can produce a <em>set</em> of URLs following 
	       its Introduction phase, even if only one Introduction mechanism is used
         (some Introduction mechanisms can themselves return multiple URLs).
	       The final output after the Exploration phase
	       can also be a <em>set</em> of Thing Descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
	       Each URL provided by the Introduction phase always points at a 
         Exploration service endpoint that will return a single Thing Description.
	       In the simplest case this is the Thing Description of a Thing 
	       describing an IoT endpoint device.  
         In the case of self-describing Things an Introduction URL might
	       even point directly at an endpoint provided by a 
         Thing serving its own Thing Description.
        </p>
        <p>
	       In general, however, Thing Descriptions might also be provided by other entities.
         For example, brownfield devices will not have been designed with the WoT
         standard in mind and so will not have been provided with the capability of serving their
         own Thing Descriptions. Also, battery-powered devices may not be online
         most of the time, or devices may not be powerful enough to manage and 
         serve TDs directly.  The Thing Description for such Things should be provided
         by separate services.
        </p>
        <p>
	       This document specifies two special cases that allow for more flexibility:
	      </p>
	      <ul>
	        <li>A Thing Description referenced by an Introduction URL 
            may describe a <a href="#exploration-td-type-thingdirectory">Thing Description Directory</a> service.  
	          A Thing Description Directory service (which is still a Thing) 
            maintains a (possibly dynamic) list of Thing Descriptions.
            Thing Description Directories that maintain large numbers of 
            Thing Descriptions may also support queries that can be used to 
            selectively retrieve Thing Descriptions.
	        </li>
	        <li>
            The second special case is a 
            <a href="#exploration-td-type-thinglink">Thing Link</a>.  
            A Thing Link is also a Thing Description,
            but rather than describing a Thing directly holds a link to
            a Thing Description hosted elsewhere.
	          A Thing Description Directory can also store Thing Links
	          which can redirect to other Thing Description Directories, 
            allowing for a linked directory structure.
	        </li>
	      </ul>
        <p>
            It is <em>not</em> mandatory for the Discovery process to retrieve
            the contents of Thing Description Directories and return them as 
            part of the results, 
            because in general this might result in a huge set of results.  
            Instead the application
            should scan the results for Thing Description Directory TDs and
            decide whether to retrieve TDs from them, possibly selectively.
            Likewise, it is not required to follow Thing Links, but the application
            should choose to follow them selectively.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="discoverer-process" class="normative">
        <h1>Discoverer Process</h1>
	<p>In this section we will describe the WoT Discovery process from the point of view of a client,
	and what it means to say that a client supports WoT Discovery.
	We will use the term <a>Discoverer</a> for an entity that is a client of the WoT Discovery
	process.  
	A Discoverer may or may not be a full Consumer.
	A Discoverer does however need to read and extract information from special TDs for Directories 
	and Thing Links and use specific affordances and links provided in them.  
	Conversely, a Consumer may not support Discovery, although it is recommended
	[[WOT-ARCHITECTURE]].
        </p>
	<p class="ednote" title="Consumers SHOULD support Discovery">
	Note: the WoT Architecture specification only says that Consumers SHOULD support Discovery.  
	</p>
        <p>
	The WoT Discovery process is designed so that nearly any client that can fetch a single TD 
	given a single URI using any protocol (including "file") can be said to support WoT Discovery. 
	Of course, Discoverers may support more powerful Discovery mechanisms, but some of these 
	have additional requirements.  
	For example, using WoT Thing Description Directories (TDDs) requires the use of HTTP, and so
	are only available to Discoverers that support this protocol.  
	However, use of HTTP (and Directories)
	is not in fact a requirement of the WoT Discovery process. 
	Some Introduction mechanisms can return multiple URLs, 
	each of which can in turn be used to fetch at least one TD.
	So even without a TDD, it is possible to discover multiple TDs.
	For example, a Discoverer supporting only CoAP may want to use
	CoRE-RD as one of its Introduction mechanisms, and a single CoRE-RD instance can provide 
	multiple links to individual TDs. 
	Such a Discoverer could also support multiple Introduction mechanisms whose results are
	merged, such as DNS-SD and CoRE-RD.
	</p>
	<p>
	The following assertions describe the specific responsibilities of a Discoverer:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="discoverer-must-support-intros">
			A Discoverer MUST support at least one Introduction mechanism.</span>
			The simplest Introduction mechanism, Direct, simply provides a single URL of a target TD.  
			This assertion results in different minimal requirements depending on
			which Introduction mechanism is selected out of the several available.
			For example, when Direct is used as the sole Introduction mechanism,
			at a minimum a Discoverer must be able to accept a single URL pointing at a TD.
			Note, however, that this TD could still be describing a Directory.
			Another option would be for a Discoverer to implement, as its sole

			A Discoverer MUST support fetching a TD from at least one URL provided as part of the Introduction process.</span>
			In other words, not only must a Discoverer accept URLs pointing at TDs, it must be
			able to fetch that TD, for example by using a GET for an HTTP URL or by reading it from a file 
			specified by way of a file URL.
			It is permissible to split the implementation of a Discoverer into two components, one that
			fetches/reads a TD and sets up a configuration during installation to be used by a
			run-time component that cannot itself read TDs.
			In this case, however, the latter component is not by itself a Discoverer.

			A Discoverer MAY support multiple invocations of the same Introduction mechanism.</span>
			If multiple invocations of a single Introduction mechanism is supported, 
			or if multiple Introduction mechanisms are used, then the Discoverer needs to
			manage a set of Introduction results.  
			Some Introduction mechanisms themselves return a set of results, e.g. CoRE-RD, DID, or DNS-SD. 
			Some mechanisms, such as scanning Bluetooth beacons, may intrinsically result in separate multiple "invocations".
			However, this Discoverer requirement is optional to support an important special case:

			Note that even if only one Introduction mechanism is supported multiple results might be 
			produced.  
			This assertion states that the overall output of the Introduction phase is
			a single set of URLs.  
			The word "set" is used here in the mathematical sense: the results are unordered and unique.
                        Uniqueness means that if multiple Introductions have the same result, they are merged into
			a single result.
			If the Discoverer only supports one Introduction mechanism and that mechanism
			can only produce one URL, then the "merge" is trivial.

                        A Discoverer can decide whether or not to follow links or fetch TDD contents.
	                There are some use cases where a Consumer may not expand certain URLs, for example links pointing
	                at external resources, or when a TDD contains many TDs and fetching them all

			field is optional. 
		</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
	The above process supports a way to let Directories reference other Directories without duplicating their TDs: 
	a Directory wanting to reference other Directories should include a <a href="#exploration-td-type-thingdirectory">Thing Link</a> with a "describedby" relation to the
	TD of the other Directory service.  Then the above process would expand the Thing Link to obtain the actual TD of the Directory, 
	and then (optionally) use the appropriate Directory affordance to access the contents of the linked Directory.
	Note that such a Thing Link points at the TD of the Directory, not at the Directory itself.  These
	may or may not be hosted in the same location.
	</p><p>
        Recursively fetching the contents of such linked directories, especially without a specific
	query or filter, could easily result in downloading a large amount of data.  Such recursive expansion should be limited to use
	cases that require it, such as inventory, auditing, or indexing.  
        </p><p>
	URLs for Directory services can also be
	used with the federation capabilities of SPARQL queries, noted below, which in most cases will be a more efficient way
	to collect specific information from a set of distributed directory services.
	However, SPARQL requires the URL of a SPARQL endpoint for such federation, which can be found in the TDs
	of Directories supporting SPARQL queries.  This is not the same as the URL pointing at the TD of a Directory.

                    The ontology includes a class for metadata that are associated with
                    TDs stored in a directory.
                    This class is called `RegistrationInformation` and described as part
                    of the directory specification in [[[#exploration-directory-registration-info]]].

                <p>
                    Moreover, the Discovery ontology defines two new Thing Description classes
                    that may be used to model special exploratory metadata:

                    <h4>Registration Expiry</h4>
                    Section [[[#exploration-directory-registration-info]]] introduces some attributes to
                    specify and discover the expiry time of registered <a>TDs</a>. 

                    <p>
                        Producers can set the expiry time to inform the directory and other consumers
                        about the validity of the TD registrations. 
                        The expiry is also a useful indicator to inform the consumers about
                        expiry of dynamic <a>TDs</a>, e.g. when changes to metadata such as
                        geolocation or properties are expected to be valid for a limited period.
                        Consumers may rely on the expiry time to know how long a retrieved <a>TD</a>
                        will be valid and when they need to request a more recent one.
                        Consumers who retrieve an expired TD may consider it as metadata of an
                        inactive client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the servers, the expiry time is useful for implementing automatic
                        removal of obsolete or accidental registrations.
                        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="tdd-registrationinfo-expiry-purge">
                            Servers SHOULD periodically purge TDs that are past 
                            their expiry times.
                        </span>
                        Prescribing a global mandate or upper limit for the expiry time is
                        application-specific and beyond the scope of this specification.
                        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="tdd-registrationinfo-expiry-config">
                            The servers MAY mandate or set a configurable upper limit to expiry times
                            and refuse incompliant requests.
                        </span>
                        
                        The purging by servers is particularly beneficial when interacting with
                        clients (e.g. IoT devices) that are unable to explicitly deregister
                        their <a>TDs</a>. This could be due to protocol-specific limitations,
                        failure, destruction, or ungraceful decommissioning.
                        Such clients should set a reasonably short expiry time and periodically
                        extend it during the normal operation. The expiry can be extended by
                        updating the registration either fully or partially, including an update that makes no
                        changes to the TD; see [[[#exploration-directory-api-things-update]]].
                       
                        If a client ceases to operate, a directory with purging capability will
                        automatically remove its registration.

                            This is often accompanied by a `WWW-Authenticate` header containing
                            information on how the client can authenticate and repeat the request.

                        For each HTTP endpoint that responds to the `GET` method, the server MUST accept `HEAD` 
                        requests and return only the headers.
                    </span>
                    This allows clients to retrieve headers such as the Content-Length without receiving the body
                    and decide on a suitable strategy to query the information. For example, a constrained client can
                    request only the necessary parts of an object (using an appropriate search query) or 
                    retrieve a list of items in small subsets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In constrained environments, a single TD may be too large to process for the server or clients.
                    This affects both read (i.e. retrieving one or more TDs or TD fragments) 
                    and write (i.e. submitting a TD or Partial TD) operations.
                    See [[[#perf-incremental-transfer]]] for protocol-specific recommendations on
                    incremental transfer of the payloads.

                    The directory APIs include mandatory, recommended, and optional
                    features. 
                    Directories that don't offer recommended or optional features
                    inform the clients about the absence of those features
                    according to the following rules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If the missing feature is to customize existing functionality of an
                            API, the server will respond with 501 (Not Implemented)
                            HTTP status.
                            For example, if a client requests a list of
                            items with a particular sorting order, the server either
                            respects that request and returns the list with the requested
                            order, or rejects the request and does not return the list.
                            The server will return the list with the default order
                            if and only if custom sorting is not requested.
                            The normative behavior is prescribed in the respective sections.

                    <h4>Things API</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Things API is a RESTful HTTP API served at the `/things` endpoint
                        providing interfaces to 
                        create, retrieve, update, delete, and list (CRUDL) <a>TDs</a>.
                        The design of this API is in accordance with [[RFC7231]] and [[?REST-IOT]].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The HTTP API follows these general rules:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="tdd-things-list-only">
                                    The API MUST provide the interface to list TDs.</span>
                                The Search API allows filtering and selection from this list; see
                                [[[#exploration-directory-api-search]]].
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                    The API MAY provide the interfaces to
                                    create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) individual TDs.</span>

                                A directory that provides both read and write over HTTP is considered
                                a full HTTP directory.

                                    Full HTTP directories SHOULD implement all of

                                It is practical to implement only the interfaces to read and list
                                if the directory serves a static collection of <a>TDs</a>.
                                This is also useful for directories that intend to expose only
                                retrieval operations over HTTP, and perform other operations via out-of-band mechanisms.

                                    To expose read-only access, the directory MUST enforce access control

                                    server-driven content negotiation.</span>
                                This is useful for applications that require serializations other than JSON.

                                    A patch operation is particularly useful to efficiently extend the expiry of
                                    a registration that uses a `ttl` (relative expiry) value.
                                    This is typically done by submitting an empty merge patch document,
                                    i.e. an empty JSON object.
                                    This effectively translates to performing a partial update operation that
                                    updates nothing, but triggers the recalculation of `expires` (absolute expiry) value.
                                    This expiry functionality only works if the server supports it as defined in
                                    [[[#exploration-directory-registration-expiry]]].
                                </p>

                                    The following example is a merge patch document to update only the
                                    `base` and registration `expires` fields of a TD:

                                            {
                                                "base": "http://192.168.0.2/",
                                                "registration": {
                                                    "expires": "2021-01-20T17:02:00Z"
                                                }

                                        </pre> 
                                        This is a valid way of extending the absolute expiry only if the stored
                                        TD has no `ttl` (relative expiry).

                            The listing endpoint provides different ways to query the collection of full TD objects
                            from the directory.

                        <p>
                            In many scenarios, retrieving parts instead of full TD objects is preferred because
                            only a subset of elements are needed (e.g. `id` and `href` of a property for all TDs)
                            and to save networking resources. The Search API allows querying parts of TD objects;

                            There may be scenarios in which clients need to retrieve the collection

                                The client requests the next page via the `next` link:

                                because this is the last page. The `etag` value has not changed implying
                                that the collection has remained consistent between the two requests.

                            The API enables server-side filtering of events to reduce resource consumption
                            by delivering only the events required by clients.
                            Client libraries may offer additional filtering capabilities on
                            the client-side.

                        There are different forms and levels of query possible, for example,
                        syntactic (JSONPath, XPath) vs. semantic (SPARQL), 
                        and the more advanced query types may not be 
                        supported by all directories.   
                        So this API will have further subsections,
                        some of which will be optional.
                        Search also includes a sub-API for managing listing the contents (e.g. returned by
                        a query) including handling pagination, etc.
                        Note that one special form of query will be able to return everything.
                        Results may be subject to the requestor's authorization.

            <h2>Amplification and Distributed Denial of Service</h2>
            <p>
	    It may also be possible to use elements of WoT Discovery
	    mechanisms to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
	    against other targets.  In such an attack the WoT Discovery
	    service itself is not the target.  Instead, an aspect of
	    the WoT Discovery service would be
	    exploited to generate amplified network traffic that overloads a third
	    party, the actual target.
	    Such an attack has two requirements: first, the ability
	    to redirect traffic to a third party, and second, 
	    an intermediary service
	    that can be exploited to amplify network traffic
	    from the attacker.
	    Redirection
	    of network traffic is possible in some protocols, such as 
	    unsecured CoAP, by modifying source information in headers.
	    Amplification is possible by taking advantage of three 
	    multiplicative factors: the ratio of request to response payload
	    sizes, use of "observe" in protocols like CoAP  
	    (which can give multiple results for one request), and use of
	    multicast (which can allow multiple servers to respond to one 
	    request). 
	    Services which do not support authentication
	    are ideal intermediaries for such an indirect attack.
	    Unfortunately, the Introduction mechanisms for WoT Discovery
	    are meant to provide open access mechanisms to initiate discovery
	    and might be exploited for this purpose.

        <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>
        <p>
            Privacy is a cross-cutting issue that needs to be considered
            in all WoT building blocks and WoT implementations. 
	    This chapter summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the privacy of concrete WoT discovery implementations.
            For a more detailed and complete analysis of both security and
            privacy issues, see the <em>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</em>
            specification [[?WOT-SECURITY]].
        </p>
        <p>
            The WoT discovery architecture is designed to avoid a dependence on the 
            privacy of existing discovery schemes by using a two-phase approach and
            allowing for the enforcement of authorization before metadata release.  
	    However several privacy risks still exist.  
	    These are listed below along with possible mitigations.
            The level of risk to privacy in particular depends on the use case and whether
            there is a risk that information related to a person might be distributed in
            a fashion inconsistent with the privacy desires of that person. 
            For privacy we distinguish the following broad classes of use case scenarios:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Institutional</dt>
            <dd>Both the Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by an institution or 
            representatives of an institution.  Example: Automation in a factory where
            a control system is accessing the state of an assembly line in order to
            evaluate quality.
            </dd>
            <dt>Service</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata  
            are owned and controlled by an institution or representatives of an institution
            while the consumers are individuals.  Example: driver of an electric vehicle 
            accessing the TD for a charge station in order to check status of a charge.
            </dd>
            <dt>Personal</dt><dd>Both the Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by the same individual.
            Example: A smart home control system for charging an electric car from
            home-attached solar panels, both home and car owned by the same person.
            </dd>
            <dt>Personal Peer-to-Peer</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by different individuals.
            Example: A smart home control system for charging a guest's electric car from
            home-attached solar panels.
            </dd>
            <dt>Institutional Peer-to-Peer</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by different institutions.
            Example: A utility provides and manages power delivered to a factory, and
            the factory provides an interface for the utility to negotiate on-demand power
            usage reductions.
            </dd>
            <dt>Client</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata  
            are owned and controlled by an individual
            while the consumers are an institution or representatives of an institution.
            Example: A personal electric vehicle exposes an interface to a public charging station 
            so that the charging station can evaluate the charge status of the vehicle.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            All of these in fact carry privacy risks.  Even in the case of factory
            automation, there is the chance that data about employee performance would
            be captured and would have to be managed appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
            With these categories established, we will now discuss some specific
            privacy risks and potential mitigations.
        </p>
        <section id="privacy-consideration-location-tracking">
            <h2>Location Tracking</h2>
            <p>
                A discovery service may potentially allow the approximate location of a person to be determined without
                their consent.  This risk occurs in some specific circumstances which can be avoided or
                mitigated.  It is also similar to the risk posed by other network services such as DHCP and DNS.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this risk to occur, there first has to be an IoT device that can be reliably associated
                with a person's location, such as a necessary medical device or a vehicle.  
                Note that the risk only applies to personal use cases, not institutional ones.
                Secondly, the
                device has to be configured to register automatically with the nearest directory service.
                In this case, the location of the device can be inferred from the network range of the directory
                service and the location of the person inferred from the location of the device.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few variants of this: 
                <ul>
                <li>The TD or Thing could report actual location information so no inferencing by network range is needed;</li>
                <li>A directory could support actual search by location;</li>
                <li>Absence of a TD in a directory could reveal negative location information.
		For example, if a TD
                    times out and is removed from a directory, that means the device has not been present for
                    a while, which could be used to infer that a person is NOT in a particular location, e.g. not at
                    home.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                Some of these risks are shared by similar services.  For example, DCHP automatically responds to 
                requests for IP addresses on a local network, and devices typically provide an identifier (a MAC
                address) as part of this process, and the DHCP server maintains a registry. In theory, someone with
                access to the DHCP server in, say, a cafe, could use this information to track someone's phone and
                infer their location.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Mitigations:</dt>
                <dd>
                There are a few options to mitigate this risk:
                <ul>
                <li>
	        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="priv-loc-disable-public-directories">
		To avoid location tracking, a WoT Thing MAY 
		disable registration with public directories.
		</span>
		Registration would still be possible with 
                personal directories, for example, a home gateway, but a user could disable registration at other
                locations.  This has the disadvantage that functionality is lost: personal devices cannot be
                discovered in public locations.  This could be addressed by having internet-accessible private
                discovery services. For example, the user's home gateway could provide an internet-accessible service, but with
                access control limiting use to authorized users.</li>
		<li>
	        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="priv-loc-anonymous-tds">
		To avoid location tracking, a WoT Thing MAY 
		use Anonymous TDs.  
		</span>
		In some cases, it may be possible to use
		anonymous TDs and omit explicit IDs from TDs submitted to
		a TDD.  In this case the TDD will generate a local ID valid
		only in that TDD.  This does, however, complicate update since the client needs to
		remember the local ID assigned by the TDD.  
		Anonymous TDs also do not prevent tracking by other means, such as 
		fingerprinting.
		</li>
                <li>
	        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="priv-loc-gen-ids">
		To avoid location tracking, a WoT Thing MAY 
		periodically generate new IDs.  
		</span>
		Using fixed IDs makes it exceptionally easy to track devices.  This problem
                also occurs in DHCP with MAC address and there is a similar partial mitigation: 
                generate new random IDs periodically.
                There are however, a few issues.  First of all, other identification information in the TD needs to be 
                hidden.  For example, client IDs issued by CSPs for API security should be omitted from TDs if 
                they cannot be easily changed.  Second, if the device generates a new ID, the user may still need to 
                know the current ID to find the device via discovery.  This can be accomplished however by generating new
                IDs using a deterministic cryptographic generator that is a function of the current time.
                However, note that regenerating IDs alone does not make tracking impossible since a TD might be fingerprinted.
                Also, updating an ID might be observable to the owner of the directory service, who could track
                and record the updated ID.  Even if the TD is deleted and reinserted the association could be 
                inferred.  This is however exactly parallel to the situation with DHCP and rotation of MAC addresses.
                In general, however, generating new IDs at least for each service or person to which a TD is supplied
                makes it harder to connect registration events at different locations and times.
	        There is a related issue with long-lived IP addresses which might need to be updated periodically
		to mitigate tracking.  In the context of ipv6 [[RFC8981]] discusses this.
                </li>
                <li>
	        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="priv-loc-gen-ids">
		To reduce the risk of negative location inferencing, access to 
                private directories SHOULD be limited by using access controls.  
		</span>
		If an attacker cannot access the service,
                they cannot retrieve information to infer location.  
		Access rights provided to guests (e.g. for Peer-to-Peer Personal scenarios)
                should be appropriately time-limited.
                Use of long time-to-live values may be appropriate in other cases.  
		In addition, TDs should be updated in a 
                directory only when they change.  
		For example, the TD for a car may only be updated when new car firmware is available
                providing new services, and the time-to-live might be set at one month (covering most absences).

            A directory service could potentially record and track queries by an individual,
            identifying that individual by their authenticated identity provided.
	    Then the set of queries associated with an individual could be used to 
	    profile that individual, and specific queries may also reveal personal information
	    about an individual.

            <h2>Incremental Transfer</h2>
	    <p>
            <a>TD</a> objects are not constrained in size. They may become 
            expensive to process and transfer individually or collectively.
            A single TD or a list of TDs could be too large for a constrained device,
            serving its own TD to consumers, submitting it to a directory,
            or consuming other TDs.

            To meet such requirements,
            servers should support incremental transfer of payloads 
            using protocol-specific mechanisms:
	    </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
		<!-- <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="perf-inc-chunked-1"> -->
                HTTP/1.1 servers should support `chunked` 
                <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.1">Transfer-Encoding</a> [[RFC7230]]
                to receive and server data incrementally.
		<!-- </span> -->

                <li>
		<!-- <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="perf-inc-chunked-2"> -->
                HTTP/2 servers should handle the data incrementally using 
                <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-4">HTTP Frames</a> [[RFC7540]].
                The HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding is not supported in HTTP/2.
                <!-- </span> -->
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
            Most HTTP servers and clients automatically process the data that is transferred 
            in chunks.
            Memory-constrained clients should consider consuming the
            received data incrementally, instead of trying to load a whole
            object in memory for de-serialization.

      <h1>Recent Specification Changes</h1>
      <h2 id="changes-from-first-draft">Changes from First Draft</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Add amplification DDOS security consideration.</li>
      <li>Split Security and Privacy Considerations into separate sections.</li>
      <li>Update name of directory service to "Thing Description Directory" with acronym TDD, 
      to avoid confusion with the acronym TD used for Thing Descriptions.
      </li>
      <li>Elaboration of complete API for registration of a Thing Description with a 
      Thing Description Directory, 
      including support for creation, update, retrieval, deletion, and listing.
      </li>
      <li>Add recommendation that TDs be validated before storage in a directory.
      Note: this corresponds to work under way in the TD spec to precisely define
      appropriate levels of automatic validation for different contexts, including
      directory registration.
      </li>
      <li>Addition of Security and Privacy Considerations 
      regarding Denial of Service and Location Tracking.
      </li>
      <li>Addition of IANA Considerations regarding CoRE Resource Types.
      </li>
      <li>Definition of Enriched TD to support embedded metadata in TDs returned by a TDD.
      </li>
      <li>Updates to description of exploration to avoid unnecessary dependence 
      on HTTP (in the future, other protocols may be supported).
      </li>
      <li>Use of "resource type" instead of "endpoint type" when describing entry in CoRE RD.
      </li>
      <li>Addition of ontology for TDDs that include the type <code>DirectoryDescription</code>
      identifying TDs of directories and 
      a type <code>LinkDescription</code> to identify a TD that is just a link to another 
      TD (useful for referring to remote directories in order to support federation).
      </li>
      <li>Add section for self-description exploration mechanism. 
      This supports the use case where a Thing hosts its own TD and peer-to-peer Thing
      communication.
      </li>
      <li>Addition of diagram showing the directory information model.
      </li>
      <li>Removal of reference to Issue 16, citing CRUD interface requirements.
      Replaced with CRUDL (CRUD + Listing) interface requirement.
      </li>
      <li>MAY assertion added to explicitly permit implementation of SPARQL federation, 
      and a requirement that if implemented, it needs to follow the SPARQL 1.1 specification.
      </li>
      <li>Updates to references: more recent versions of CoRE RD, DID Core, Eventsource, JSON-LD, 
      and JSON Path specifications. 
      Use of datatracker service (and URLs) to reference IETF RFCs. 
      Addition of normative references to RFC7396 and RFC7540.

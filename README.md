To propose changes, create a PR following the procedures given in the [wot repo](https://github.com/w3c/wot).
Also please create issues to note problems in the current content for which a solution is needed (ideally
issues propose a suitable solution.  It should also be clear under what condition issues have been resolved
so they can be closed when those conditions are met).

        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
           interoperability across IoT platforms and application
           domains.  One key mechanism for accomplishing this goal
           is the definition and use of metadata describing the
           interactions an IoT device or service makes available
           over the network at a suitable level of abstraction.  
           The WoT Thing Description specification satisfies this objective.
        </p>
        <p>However, in order to use a Thing its Thing Description
           first has to be obtained.  The <em>WoT Discovery</em> process described 
           in this document addresses this problem.
           WoT Discovery needs to support the distribution of WoT Thing Descriptions
           in a variety of use cases.  This includes ad-hoc and engineered systems;
           during development and at runtime; and on both local and global networks.
           The process also needs to work with existing discovery mechanisms,
           be secure, protect private information, and be able to efficiently
           handle updates to WoT Thing Descriptions and the 
           dynamic and diverse nature of the IoT ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>The WoT Discovery process is divided into two phases,
           Introduction, and Exploration.  The Introduction phase 
           leverages existing discovery mechanisms but does not directly
           expose metadata; they are simply used to discover Exploration
           services, which provide metadata but only after secure authentication
           and authorization.  This document normatively defines two Exploration
           services, one for WoT Thing self-description with a single 
           WoT Thing Description and a searchable WoT Thing Description Directory
           service for collections of Thing Descriptions.
           A variety of Introduction services are also described and where
           necessary normative definitions are given to support them.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Web of Things (WoT) defines an architecture that supports the integration
           and use of web technologies with IoT devices.
           The WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture]] document defines the basic
           concepts and patterns of usage supported.
           However, the WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] is a key
           specification for WoT Discovery since it is the purpose of WoT Discovery
           to make WoT Thing Descriptions available.
           Specifically, WoT Discovery has to allow authenticated and authorized entities
           (and only those entities) to find WoT Thing Descriptions satisfying a set of
           criteria, such as being near a certain location, or having certain semantics,
           or containing certain interactions.  Conversely, in order to support
           security and privacy objectives, the WoT Discovery process must not
           leak information to unauthorized entities.  This includes leaking information
           that a given entity is requesting certain information, not just the information
           distributed in the Thing Descriptions themselves.
	    </p>
        <p>There are already a number of discovery mechanisms defined, so we have to 
           establish why we are proposing a new one.  First, many existing 
           discovery mechanisms have relatively weak security and privacy protections.
           One of our objectives is to establish a mechanism that not only uses best
           practices to protect metadata, but that can be upgraded to support future
           best practices as needed.
           Second, we are using discovery in a broad sense to include both local and
           non-local mechanisms.  While a local mechanism might use a broadcast protocol,
           non-local mechanisms might go beyond the current network segment where broadcast
           is not scalable, and so a different approach, such as a search service, is needed. 
           Our approach is to use existing mechanisms as needed to bootstrap into a more 
           general and secure metadata distribution system.
           Third, the metadata we are distributing, the WoT Thing Description, is highly
           structured and includes rich data such as data schemas and semantic annotations.
           Existing discovery mechanisms based on a list of simple key-value pairs are 
           not appropriate.  
           At the same time, 
           use of existing standards for semantic data query, 
           such as SPARQL [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]], 
           while potentially suitable for some advanced use cases, 
           might require too much effort for many anticipated IoT applications.
           Therefore in order to address more basic applications,
           we also define some simpler query mechanisms. 
        </p>
        <p>After defining some basic terminology, we will summarize the basic use cases and
           requirements for WoT Discovery.  These are a subset of the more detailed and
           exhaustive use cases and requirements presented in the WoT Use Cases [[wot-usecases]] and 
           WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture]] documents.
           Then we will describe the basic architecture of the WoT Discovery process,
           which uses a two-phase Introduction/Exploration approach.  The basic goal of this
           architecture is to be able to use existing discovery standards to bootstrap
           access to protected discovery services, but to distribute detailed metadata only to 
           authorized users, and to also protect those making queries from eavesdroppers 
           as much as possible.
           We then describe details of specific Introduction and Exploration mechanisms.
           In particular, we define in detail a normative API for a 
           WoT Thing Description Directory (WoT TDD) service that provides a search mechanism for
           collections of WoT Thing Descriptions that can be dynamically registered by Things or
           entities acting on their behalf.  The WoT Discovery mechanism however also supports
           self-description by individual Things and one issue we address is how to distinguish
           between these two approaches.
           Finally, we discuss some security and privacy considerations, including a set of 
           potential risks and mitigations.

                    <h4>Registration Expiry</h4>
                    Section [[[#exploration-directory-registration-info]]] introduces few attributes to
                    specify and discover the expiry time of registered <a>TD</a>s. 

                    <p>
                        Producers can set the expiry time to inform the directory and other consumers
                        about the validity of the TD registrations. 
                        The expiry is also a useful indicator to inform the consumers about
                        expiry of dynamic <a>TD</a>s, e.g. when changes to metadata such as
                        geolocation or properties are expected to be valid for a limited period.
                        Consumers may rely on the expiry time to know how long a retrieved <a>TD</a>
                        will be valid and when they need to request a more recent one.
                        Consumers who retrieve an expired TD may consider it as metadata of an
                        inactive client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the servers, the expiry time is useful for implementing automatic
                        removal of obsolete or accidental registrations.
                        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="tdd-registrationinfo-expires-purge">
                            Servers SHOULD periodically purge TDs that are past 
                            their expiry times.
                        </span>
                        Prescribing a global mandate or upper limit for the expiry time is
                        application-specific and beyond the scope of this specification.
                        <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="tdd-registrationinfo-expires-purge">
                            The servers MAY mandate or set a configurable upper limit to expiry times
                            and refuse incompliant requests.
                        </span>
                        
                        The purging by servers is particularly beneficial when interacting with
                        clients (e.g. IoT devices) that are unable to explicitly deregister
                        their <a>TD</a>s. This could be due to protocol-specific limitations,
                        failure, destruction, or ungraceful decommissioning.
                        Such clients should set a reasonably short expiry time and periodically
                        extend it during the normal operation.
                       
                        If a client ceases to operate, a directory with purging capability will
                        automatically remove its registration.

                            As such, servers should serialize incrementally and utilize protocol-specific
                            mechanisms to respond in chunks.

                                to allow optional pagination of the JSON-LD array.
                                Additional parts of Linked Data Paging may be implemented for examples
                                to honour client's query preference or to add other link relations for semantic

                                The client requests the list with a `limit` of 10:
                                <pre>
                                    GET /td?limit=10 HTTP/1.1

                                The response includes two Link headers with relative URLs:
                                `next` link to query the remaining TDs,
                                `canonical` link referencing the full collection with `etag` value indicating
                                the state of that collection.

                                The response body is an array of 10 TDs.

                                The presence of the `next` link implies that subsequent pages should be
                                queried for the remaining TDs.
                                The client requests the next page via the `next` link:
                                <pre>
                                    GET /td?offset=10&limit=10 HTTP/1.1

                                </pre>
                                The server response has the remaining two TDs. There is no `next` link,
                                because this is the last page. The `etag` value has not changed implying
                                that the collection has remained consistent between the two requests.

                        <dd>
                            The API enables server-side filtering of events to reduce resource consumption
                            by delivering only the events required by clients.
                            Client libraries may offer additional filtering capabilities on
                            the client-side.
                            The server-side filtering is based on query parameters passed to the server at 
                            connection time. The filtering behavior is described below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                        The server MUST support event filtering based on the 
                                        event types passed as one or more `type` query parameters.
                                    </span>
                                    For example, in response to query `?type=create&type=delete`,
                                    the server will only deliver events of types `create` and `delete`.
                                    At the absence of any `type` query parameter, the server will deliver all
                                    types of events.
                                </li>

                        syntactic (JSONPath, XPath) vs. semantic (SPARQL), 
                        and the more advanced query types may not be

                        So this API will have further subsections,
                        some of which will be optional.
                        Search also includes a sub-API for managing listing the contents (eg returned by
                        a query) including handling pagination, etc.
                        Note that one special form of query will be able to return everything.
                        Results may be subject to the requestor's authorization.

        <h1>Security and Privacy Considerations</h1>
        <p>
            Security and privacy are cross-cutting issues that need to be considered
            in all WoT building blocks and WoT implementations. This chapter
            summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the security and privacy of concrete WoT discovery implementations.
            For a more detailed and complete analysis of security and
            privacy issues, see the <em>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</em>
            specification [[?WOT-SECURITY]].
        </p>
        <p>
            The WoT discovery architecture is designed to avoid a dependence on the security
            and privacy of existing discovery schemes by using a two-phase approach and
            requiring authorization before metadata release.  However several security and
            privacy risks still exist.  These are listed below along with possible mitigations.
            The level of risk to privacy in particular depends on the use case and whether
            there is a risk that information related to a person might be distributed in
            a fashion inconsistent with the privacy desires of that person. 
            We distinguish the following broad classes of use case scenarios:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Institutional</dt>
            <dd>Both the Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by an institution or 
            representatives of an institution.  Example: Automation in a factory where
            a control system is accessing the state of an assembly line in order to
            evaluate quality.
            </dd>
            <dt>Service</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata  
            are owned and controlled by an institution or representatives of an institution
            while the consumers are individuals.  Example: driver of an electric vehicle 
            accessing the TD for a charge station in order to check status of a charge.
            </dd>
            <dt>Personal</dt><dd>Both the Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by the same individual.
            Example: A smart home control system for charging an electric car from
            home-attached solar panels, both home and car owned by the same person.
            </dd>
            <dt>Personal Peer-to-Peer</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by different individuals.
            Example: A smart home control system for charging a guest's electric car from
            home-attached solar panels.
            </dd>
            <dt>Institutional Peer-to-Peer</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata and 
            the Consumers of that metadata are owned and controlled by different institutions.
            Example: A utility provides and manages power delivered to a factory, and
            the factory provides an interface for the utility to negotiate on-demand power
            usage reductions.
            </dd>
            <dt>Client</dt><dd>The Things producing metadata  
            are owned and controlled by an individual
            while the consumers are an institution or representatives of an institution.
            Example: A personal electric vehicle exposes an interface to a public charging station 
            so that the charging station can evaluate the charge status of the vehicle.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            All of these in fact carry privacy risks.  Even in the case of factory
            automation, there is the chance that data about employee performance would
            be captured and would have to be managed appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
            With these categories established, we will now discuss some specific
            risks and potential mitigations.

                This is mostly of concern in the Service scenario, where the 
                metadata requester is a private individual and the provider is an institution.
                In some cases this risk may appear in Peer-to-Peer scenarios as well.

<!-- Notes from issue https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/issues/196
* Sensitivity of geolocation information (when we have it) for privacy when device is associated with a person, 
i.e. location of a personal vehicle. This also includes inferred location, e.g. directory estimates location of device based on wifi range.
* Sensitivity of directory metadata, e.g. last update (watch, periodic TD updates, time of last update can be used to infer if someone is home...).  Note: similar to DHCP metadata risk.
* Sensitivity of thing ids (again, when device is associated with a person)
* Query injection (SPARQL and javascript fragments in JSON path) allowing execution of arbitrary code on the server
    - SPARQL is language-sandboxed but DDoS is possible
    - JSONpath needs to have its power limited, e.g. should not allow arbitrary embedded JS but 
      instead only specific expressions, e.g. string and numeric comparison; 
      regex's are a challenge, we need to look at specific features of regexes, e.g. embedded script execution. 
      A JSON path standard that already deals with this would be useful, but... 
    - To do: look at Xpath spec to see if these issues are dealt with. 
      One path here is to only allow features in JSON Path that are equivalent to some feature in Xpath, 
      assuming Xpath has already had its power suitably limited
    - Not actually a risk; it's something we should design out!
* Access control for directories; 
  directories have authentication, maybe some information is limited to certain categories of users; 
  should the standard specify an admin interface to control this?
* Should "nosec" be allowed as a security scheme in some circumstances?
* Good access control can mitigate some of the other risks.
* Location may be implicit. 
  If a TD simply appears in a directory, 
  then we know the Thing is in range (e.g. of WiFi) so it can register with the TDD
* Sensitivity of client IDs associated with some security schemes. 
  These may be harder to rotate than Thing IDs. 
  Mitigation: hide IDs by treating them as private information (see "uri" examples)
* Mitigations for a lot of these are mitigated by access control. However...
  This still allows tracking by "authorized" parties, 
  which if you don't own the hardware could be anyone 
  (e.g. the police, a random guy in the IT department of the traffic department, etc). Options:
     * Turn off registration; this however just disables discovery
     * Encrypt the TD; makes search, validation, etc. impossible
       Also still requires some way to identify the TD, which could then be used for tracking by a third party.
     * Move location information to a property of the Thing and don't store in the directory. 
       This however would disable geospatial discovery
  In general, "disabling" geolocation for personal devices may be necessary, 
  although it still is useful for institutional use cases
* Another option would be to use a "code generator" to generate IDs (perhaps in combination with encrypted TDs) 
  that is synchronized between the device and another application available to the user. 
  So, for example, a user could use an app on their laptop to generate the current ID 
  and then do a discovery search to find the location of their car, 
  which had registered an encrypted TD with that (rotating) ID with a discovery service.
* We should study how/if there are any solutions for this in phones, etc.
* Probably we need to allow "nosec" although it's probably a very bad idea except for development use cases. 
     * We could perhaps add an assertion that 
       "If a TDD service is available to anyone other than the developer and supports 
       registration of third-party TDs then it MUST NOT use the "nosec" scheme."
     * Some non-nosec options are still insecure so perhaps we should be more specific about good options. 
       We could just refer to the "security best practices" and say 
       "one of the recommended best-practice security schemes should be used"
     * Encrypted TDs would not be able to support many features of discovery, 
       including queries (except for retrieving TDs by ID), validation
     * We would also have to disable notifications in the directory because when an ID is updated, 
       we want to delete the old TD and create a new one with a new TD. 
       Sending notifications of an update would defeat the purpose.
     * A tracker could still watch for deletions followed immediately by creations and "guess" 
       that this is an update (and update their tracker to the new ID). 
     * The tracker would have to be the owner of the directory in this case. 
     * This however, by itself, just allows the persistent presence of a device to be inferred. 
     * However, it might be possible to combine this with other information eg. from DHCP logs 
       (granting IPs to a new device with a known MAC), proxy logs, 
       IP address of registration request to the directory. 
     * Similar risk with phones (MAC address), similar mitigations (e.g. rotate MAC address).
* Need to clarify use cases
     * Institutional (factory, smart city) - publishing public services
     * Private (personal use) - services that you want available from remote locations (e.g. access car in parking garage charging station from cafe, e.g. to check status of charge)
* Alternative to encrypted TDs: Private Directories.
     * Register personal devices only to directories that only you have access rights to, 
       e.g. hosted in your personal home gateway

Note: not all of the above risks belong in this section.  In particular, if a risk can be designed out
(e.g. making it impossible to do query injection) then we should do so.  Access controls should also
be discussed elsewhere and perhaps mentioned as tools for addressing the following.

            <h2>Location Tracking</h2>
            <p>
                A discovery service may potentially allow the approximate location of a person to be determined without
                their consent.  This risk occurs in some specific circumstances which can be avoided or
                mitigated.  It is also similar to the risk posed by other network services such as DHCP and DNS.

                For this risk to occur, there first has to be an IoT device that can be reliably associated
                with a person's location, such as a necessary medical device or a vehicle.  
                Note that the risk only applies to personal use cases, not institutional ones.
                Secondly, the
                device has to be configured to register automatically with the nearest directory service.
                In this case, the location of the device can be inferred from the network range of the directory
                service and the location of the person inferred from the location of the device.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few variants of this: 
                <ul>
                <li>The TD or Thing could report actual location information so no inferencing by network range is needed;</li>
                <li>A directory could support actual search by location;</li>
                <li>Absence of a TD in a directory could reveal negative location information (e.g. if a TD
                    times out and is removed from a directory, that means the device has not been present for
                    a while, which could be used to infer that a person is NOT in a particular location, e.g. not at
                    home.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                Some of these risks are shared by similar services.  For example, DCHP automatically responds to 
                requests for IP addresses on a local network, and devices typically provide an identifier (a MAC
                address) as part of this process, and the DHCP server maintains a registry. In theory, someone with
                access to the DHCP server in, say, a cafe, could use this information to track someone's phone and
                infer their location.

                <dd>
                There are a few options to mitigate this risk:
                <ul>
                <li>Disable registration with public directories.  Registration would still be possible with 
                personal directories, for example, a home gateway, but a user could disable registration at other
                locations.  This has the disadvantage that functionality is lost: personal devices cannot be
                discovered in public locations.  This could be addressed by having internet-accessible private
                discovery services (e.g. the home gateway could provide an internet-accessible service, but with
                access control limiting use to authorized users.</li>
                <li>Rotate IDs.  Using fixed IDs makes it exceptionally easy to track devices.  This problem
                also occurs in DHCP with MAC address and there is a similar partial mitigation: 
                generate new random IDs periodically.
                There are however, a few issues.  First of all, other identification information in the TD needs to be 
                hidden.  For example, client IDs issued by CSPs for API security should be omitted from TDs if 
                they cannot be easily rotated.  Second, if the device rotates the ID, the user may still need to 
                know the current ID to find the device via discovery.  This can be accomplished however by generating new
                IDs using a deterministic cryptographic generator that is a function of the current time.
                However, note that rotating IDs alone does not make tracking impossible since a TD might be fingerprinted.
                Also, updating an ID might be observable to the owner of the directory service, who could track
                and record the updated ID.  Even if the TD is deleted and reinserted the association could be 
                inferred.  This is however exactly parallel to the situation with DHCP and rotation of MAC addresses.
                In general, however, generating new IDs at least for each service or person to which a TD is supplied
                makes it harder to connect registration events at different locations and times.
                </li>
                <li>The problem of negative location inferencing can be mitigated by limiting access to 
                private directories, for example in the home, by using access controls.  If an attacker cannot access the service,
                they cannot retrieve information to infer location.  Access rights provided to guests (Peer-to-Peer Personal)
                should be appropriately time-limited.
                Use of long time-to-live values may be appropriate in other cases.  In addition, TDs should be updated in a 
                directory only when they change.  For example, the TD for a car may only be updated when new car firmware is available
                providing new services, and the time-to-live might be set at one month (covering most absences).
                </li>
                <li>When explicit location information is available, whether stored in a TD or available in a property,
                additional care should be taken to only share the TD and/or access to the device with trusted partners,
                including directories.  If the TD must be shared with a public directory, the location information can be 
                stripped.

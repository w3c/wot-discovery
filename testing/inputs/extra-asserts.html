<h1>Extra Assertions</h1>
<p>These are a collection of additional assertions used for testing,
but which are (currently) not included in the specification.
These are candidates for being put in the specification
and are given here only to stage them in order to facilitate timely
generation of the implementation report.
In the final report this
list should probably be empty.
</p>
<ul>
<!-- The following have been moved to "Behavior" section of spec, but are left here
     to serve as a template for any new assertions. 
<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="client-data-schema">
A WoT Thing acting as a client when interacting with another Thing MUST generate data payloads 
according to the data schemas given in the target Thing's WoT Thing Description.
</span></li>
<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="client-uri-template">
A WoT Thing acting as a client when interacting with another Thing MUST generate URIs 
according to the URI templates, base URLs, and form href parameters 
given in the target Thing's WoT Thing Description.
</span></li>

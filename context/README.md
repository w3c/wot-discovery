# Discovery Ontology and Context

This directory contains files for both the WoT Discovery Ontology and the
related JSON-LD Context.
The Ontology is defined in the Turtle file `discovery-ontology.ttl`.
A human-readable HTML version of the Ontology is generated by the script in
`renderOntology.js` and saved as `discovery-ontology.html`.

## Rendering the Ontology as HTML

In order to render the ontology as HTML, you need Node.js installed.
First, install the necessary dependencies by running

```sh
    npm install
```

in the top-level directory.
Then, to start the actual rendering process, you can run

```sh
    npm run render
```

also from the top-level directory.

The rendering process differs slightly from the one in the Thing Description
repository, as it uses the `STTL.js` library from a script written in JavaScript
instead from a shell script.

        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
           interoperability across IoT platforms and application
           domains.  One key mechanism for accomplishing this goal
           is the definition and use of metadata describing the
           interactions an IoT device or service makes available
           over the network at a suitable level of abstraction.  
           The WoT Thing Description specification satisfies this objective.
        </p>
        <p>However, in order to use a Thing its Thing Description
           first has to be obtained.  The <em>WoT Discovery</em> process described 
           in this document addresses this problem.
           WoT Discovery needs to support the distribution of WoT Thing Descriptions
           in a variety of use cases.  This includes ad-hoc and engineered systems;
           during development and at runtime; and on both local and global networks.
           The process also needs to work with existing discovery mechanisms,
           be secure, protect private information, and be able to efficiently
           handle updates to WoT Thing Descriptions and the 
           dynamic and diverse nature of the IoT ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>The WoT Discovery process is divided into two phases,
           Introduction, and Exploration.  The Introduction phase 
           leverages existing discovery mechanisms but does not directly
           expose metadata; they are simply used to discover Exploration
           services, which provide metadata but only after secure authentication
           and authorization.  This document normatively defines two Exploration
           services, one for WoT Thing self-description with a single 
           WoT Thing Description and a searchable WoT Thing Directory
           service for collections of Thing Descriptions.
           A variety of Introduction services are also described and where
           necessary normative definitions are given to support them.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Web of Things (WoT) defines an architecture that supports the integration
           and use of web technologies with IoT devices.
           The WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture]] document defines the basic
           concepts and patterns of usage supported.
           However, the WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] is a key
           specification for WoT Discovery since it is the purpose of WoT Discovery
           to make WoT Thing Descriptions available.
           Specifically, WoT Discovery has to allow authenticated and authorized entities
           (and only those entities) to find WoT Thing Descriptions satisfying a set of
           criteria, such as being near a certain location, or having certain semantics,
           or containing certain interactions.  Conversely, in order to support
           security and privacy objectives, the WoT Discovery process must not
           leak information to unauthorized entities.  This includes leaking information
           that a given entity is requesting certain information, not just the information
           distributed in the Thing Descriptions themselves.
	</p>
        <p>There are already a number of discovery mechanisms defined, so we have to 
           establish why we are proposing a new one.  First, many existing 
           discovery mechanisms have relatively weak security and privacy protections.
           One of our objectives is to establish a mechanism that not only uses best
           practices to protect metadata, but that can be upgraded to support future
           best practices as needed.
           Second, we are using discovery in a broad sense to include both local and
           non-local mechanisms.  While a local mechanism might use a broadcast protocol,
           non-local mechanisms might go beyond the current network segment where broadcast
           is not scalable, and so a different approach, such as a search service, is needed. 
           Our approach is to use existing mechanisms as needed to bootstrap into a more 
           general and secure metadata distribution system.
           Third, the metadata we are distributing, the WoT Thing Description, is highly
           structured and includes rich data such as data schemas and semantic annotations.
           Existing discovery mechanisms based on a list of simple key-value pairs are 
           not appropriate.  
           At the same time, 
           use of existing standards for semantic data query, 
           such as SPARQL [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]], 
           while potentially suitable for some advanced use cases, 
           might require to much effort for many anticipated IoT applications.
           Therefore in order to address more basic applications,
           we also define some simpler query mechanisms. 
        </p>
        <p>After defining some basic terminology, we will summarize the basic use cases and
           requirements for WoT Discovery.  These are a subset of the more detailed and
           exhaustive use cases and requirements presented in the WoT Use Cases [[wot-usecases]] and 
           WoT Architecture [[wot-architecture]] documents.
           Then we will describe the basic architecture of the WoT Discovery process,
           which uses a two-phase Introduction/Exploration approach.  The basic goal of this
           architecture is to be able to use existing discovery standards to bootstrap
           access to protected discovery services, but to distribute detailed metadata only to 
           authorized users, and to also protect those making queries from eavesdroppers 
           as much as possible.
           We then describe details of specific Introduction and Exploration mechanisms.
           In particular, we define in detail a normative API for a 
           WoT Thing Description Directory (WoT TDD) service that provides a search mechanism for
           collections of WoT Thing Descriptions that can be dynamically registered by Things or
           entities acting on their behalf.  The WoT Discovery mechanism however also supports
           self-description by individual Things and one issue we address is how to distinguish
           between these two approaches.
           Finally, we discuss some security and privacy considerations, including a set of 
           potential risks and mitigations.

                    The HTTP API responses must use appropriate status codes described in

                            The API supports server-side filtering of events to reduce resource consumption
                            by delivering only the events required by clients.
                            The filtering is based on query parameters passed to the server at 
                            connection time. The filtering behavior is described below:
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                    </span>
                                    For example, in response to query `?type=created_td&type=deleted_td`,
                                    the server must only deliver events of types `created_td` and `deleted_td`.
                                    At the absence of any `type` query parameter, the server must deliver all
                                    types of events.

                    Sub-API to search a directory, e.g. issue a query.
                    There are different forms and levels of query possible, for example,
                    syntactic (JSONPath, XPath) vs. semantic (SPARQL), 
                    and the more advanced query types may not be 
                    supported by all directories.   
                    So this API will have further subsections,
                    some of which will be optional.
                    Search also includes a sub-API for managing listing the contents (eg returned by
                    a query) including handling pagination, etc.
                    Note that one special form of query will be able to return everything.
                    Results may be subject to the requestor's authorization.

        <h1>Security and Privacy Considerations</h1>
        <p>
            Security and privacy are cross-cutting issues that need to be considered
            in all WoT building blocks and WoT implementations. This chapter
            summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the security and privacy of concrete WoT discovery implementations.
            For a more detailed and complete analysis of security and
            privacy issues, see the <em>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</em>
            specification [[?WOT-SECURITY]].
        </p>
        <p class="ednote" title="Discovery Security and Privacy Concerns and Mitigations">
        To do, some discussion of general security and privacy concerns and mitigations.
        Note that the architecture above is designed to address many such points, for
        example the two-phase approach and "authorization before metadata release"
        principles, so this would be 
        a summary and a recap.

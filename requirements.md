# WoT Discovery 

## Requirements

The WoT discovery process should have the following capabilities:

### System
* Support peer-to-peer (self-identifying), local (network segment),
  and global (internet-wide) discovery.
* Support discovery via third-party services (e.g. a directory service)
  in order to support sleeping devices and search over collections.
* Be compatible with discovery support in the WoT Scripting API.

### Search
* Support various forms of query, including keyword, template, 
  and semantic queries.
* Support spatial and sub-net limited queries.
* Support queries that can span a subnet or multiple directory services.
* Be scalable to large databases of TDs.

### Data Management
* Support both Dynamic and Static TDs.
* Support explicit deletion and access control management of TDs.
* Automatically clean up TDs for devices that are no longer accessible or active.

### Security
* Support best known methods for confidentiality and authentication.
* Support authorization and role management.

### Privacy
* Support authentication and authorization mechanisms that do not reveal user identities.
* Support device and information lifecycle, trust management, access controls.
* Distribute TDs and other metadata only to authenticated and authorized entities.
* Donâ€™t leak TDs, other metadata, or queries to unauthorized entities.

### Alignment with Existing Standards
* Align with IETF CoRE Resource Directories, CoRE Link Format, and DIDs.
* Be accessible via a variety of existing discovery mechanisms,
  including DNS-SD, DNS-SRV, DHCP, QR codes, and Bluetooth beacons.

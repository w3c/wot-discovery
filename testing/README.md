# Implementation Report

This directory contains the
[WoT Discovery Implementation report](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery/testing/report.html)
and the sources for it.
The report itself is in [report.html](report.html).
Do not edit this file,
it is generated by a script
and any edits would be overwritten the next time you generate it.

For adding test data, please see https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/main/data/input_2022/Discovery/README.md.
It is preferrable to add test results to that repo rather than here.  Test results will be updated here when the 
implementation report is updated, and might get overwritten.
